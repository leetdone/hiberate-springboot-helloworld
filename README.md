In this project, I did the following things:

1. configure a full stack app, including frontend, backend, database.

In the frontend, I used framework like bootstrap to build the html pages, and I used Thymeleaf to manage the app.

In the backend, I config hiberate and connect the spring boot with MySQL database.

2. use Git to push the file to the repo

Instead of using graphic github, I learned and used Git command to push the code to the remote repo. During that time, I learned how to connect local repo to remote repo.
How to deal with conficts.
